            CS@Harvard is a course selection tool designed to assist Harvard undergraduates in their journey through CS following CS50.
            CS50 provides the fundamental building blocks for all CS courses at Harvard in promoting computational thinking and
            introducing students to basic programming languages starting with C. Moreover, CS50 is widely renowned as the course one
            takes as an introduction to CS at Harvard. All of this has made CS50 one of the most enrolled courses at Harvard.
            Consequently, it became incumbent on us to provide a service to the many CS50 graduates that assists their search for more
            advanced CS courses. Our website allows students to filter and compare classes based on course ratings,
            professor reviews, average weekly workload, and other criteria to best optimise their choices.

            <ul class = "circle">
                <li>Total Students: Provides user with a rough estimate of class size. May be of importance if the user wishes to have a
                range of small and large classes for their next semester.</li>
                <li>Proportion of Undergraduates: Reflection of how many undergraduates to graduates taking the course.</li>
                <li>Workload: The average number of hours outside of lessons students spend on the course.</li>
                <li>Course Score: A general summary out of 5 on the quality of the materials, assignments, feedback and section for each course.</li>
                <li>Instructor Score: A general summary out of 5 on how informative or useful the instructor is in terms of giving effective
                lectures or presentations, being accessible outside of class, facilitating discussion and encouraging participation,
                giving useful feedback and returning assignments in a timely fashion.</li>
                <li>Recommend: To what extent would graduates of the course recommend that others take it the next time that it is
                offered?</li>

        </p>
        <p class = "text1">
            The figures provided for each course are based on student evaluations and college enrolment statistics for the latest
            semester in which that course was offered. Since then, courses may have changed such that the next time they are offered
            they may have different instructors, problem sets and/or syllabus content. Updates on any changes to courses will be appear
            on the website as soon as we receive notice, but they will be by no means comprehensive. It is ultimately up to users to
            determine to what extent our data can reliably predict course outcomes in the future.
