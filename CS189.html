        <b>Description:</b>
        <br>
        Building autonomous robotic systems requires understanding how to make robots that observe, reason, and act.
        Each component uses many engineering principles: how to fuse, multiple, noisy sensors; how to balance short-term
        versus long-term goals; how to control oneâ€™s actions and how to coordinate with others. This year theme will be
        "Robots Roam the Halls", where we will focus on kinect-based robots that move in the SEAS buildings, to do
        applications like navigating, map building, and interacting with people. The class format will have a mixed
        lecture and lab format, and have a final project component.
        <br><br>
        <b>Recommended Prep:</b>
        <br>
        The only prerequisites are CS51 or CS61, or experience with programming and using APIs. This class is appropriate
        for CS, EE, and ME students interested in robotics.
