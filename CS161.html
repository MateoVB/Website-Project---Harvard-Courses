        <br>
        This course focuses on the design and implementation of modern operating systems. The course discusses threads,
        processes, virtual memory, schedulers, and the other fundamental primitives that an OS uses to represent active
        computations. An exploration of the system call interface explains how applications interact with hardware and other
        programs which are concurrently executing. Case studies of popular file systems reveal how an OS makes IO efficient
        and robust in the midst of crashes and unexpected reboots. Students also learn how virtualization allows a physical
        machine to partition its resources across multiple virtual machines. Class topics are reinforced through a series of
        intensive programming assignments which use a real operating system.
