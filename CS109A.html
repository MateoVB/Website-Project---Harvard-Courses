        <b>Description:</b>
        <br>
        Data Science 1 is the first half of a one-year introduction to data science. The course will focus on the analysis of
        messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will
        integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and
        sampling to get a suitable data set;  (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data
        analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication
        – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Part one of a two part series.
        The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both
        the fall and spring course within the same academic year.
