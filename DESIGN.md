CS@Harvard is a new innovative tool aimed at aiding the selection of CS courses for undergraduates at Harvard. Unlike existing course
selection tools, CS@Harvard allows students to customise their schedule by filtering and comparing courses in CS based on workload,
recommendations, class size and quality of instructor. CS@Harvard recognises that there is not a "one size fits all" approach to CS,
but rather students may wish to follow a variety of paths after CS50. By providing the data in a convenient and user-friendly fashion,
we hope to increase enrolment in CS courses while ensuring that students are taking the courses most suited to their needs.

For the style of the website, we have tried to emphasise that this website is dedicated to Harvard students; thus, we have chosen a colour
palette that most resembles Harvard's own website and the CS50 website. This can be seen in the header and footer of our website as well as
in the tables that we have implemented. For the text, we chose to use Verdana as our font for all the pages, a simple and legible font
that adds a level of professionalism to our website.

In the "All" section of the website, we have created a table of all the CS courses at Harvard as shown in the Unofficial Guide to CS at
Harvard. We have chosen these courses as we believe they would be most relevant to undergraduates at Harvard wishing to explore CS further
after taking CS50. As the user hovers over a row, that row becomes highlighted (once again in Harvard's recognisable crimson). Users may
then click on the row in order to find more information on that course including a general course description, course requirements and more.

The same can be done in the "Searched" and "Compared" pages, whereby users have access to more information displayed in the table. Data
exhibited includes the proportion of undergraduates taking the course, course ratings, instructor ratings and more. We decided to
leave out this information in the "All" page as we felt that this would be too much for the user to digest. Instead, this information is
much more useful once users have filtered out courses either in "Search" or "Compare".

We chose to implement these two pages since we recognised that for some users, they may not have any courses that currently pique their
interest; however, they may want a course that does not require a large weekly workload, or they may want to take into account the quality
of the instructor. This is where "Search" comes in. For those who already have a good idea what they would like to take but would wish to
find out more, "Compare" is the page that they ought to turn to.
