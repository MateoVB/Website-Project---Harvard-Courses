        <br>
        The course covers skills and techniques necessary to design innovative interactive products that are useful,
        usable and that address important needs of people other than yourself. You will learn how to uncover needs that
        your customers cannot even articulate. You will also learn a range of design principles, effective creativity-related
        practices, and techniques for rapidly creating and evaluating product prototypes. You will also have several
        opportunities to formally communicate your design ideas to a variety of audiences. You will complete two large
        team-based design projects.
